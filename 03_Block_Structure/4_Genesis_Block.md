# Logic: The Genesis Block

## Definition
The First Block (Block #0). The start of history.

## Why it is Special
1.  **No Previous Hash:** It cannot point to a past block because none exists.
2.  **Hard Coded:** It is manually created by the developers, not mined.

## Auditor Checklist
*   **Initial Supply:** The Genesis block defines how many coins exist at the start.
*   **The "Pre-mine":** If the Genesis block gives 50% of tokens to the developer's wallet, that is a "Centralization Risk."
*   **Hard Forking:** If a community disagrees, they copy the chain but change the rules. They share the same Genesis block history until the split.
